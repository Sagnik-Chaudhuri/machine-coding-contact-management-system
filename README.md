# machine-coding-contact-management-system

LLD Contact Management System
- Functionality:
  - Add/update contact(s)
  - Search contacts (partial - prefix or complete) (Note in all searches show the total count & search results)
  - Search by first name (search term is case insensitive)
  - Search by last name (search term is case insensitive)
  - Search by phone number

- Expectations:
  - Identify all the entities and attributes required for the above functionality
  - Please donâ€™t create REST APIs or any UI for the same.
  - Please don't use any database or data stores for this. You can store the data in-memory data structures.
  - You can test the functionality using unit test cases.
  - The focus is on the core functionality and how it is implemented v/s how it is presented (UI or API structure).
  - Use coding best practices (SOLID, DRY, etc.) and ensure that you are writing modular & extensible code (to accommodate any future changes in functionality)
